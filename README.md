Personal website (that will not be used most likely) that was developed to include my first project called "JazzList".

JazzList showcases 12 of my all-time favorite jazz saxophonists. By clicking on an artist's profile, you'll find detailed information about them, including a couple of my favorite musical compositions or solo improvisations from those artists.

If you would like to know more about JazzList or myself, visit: https://jacobklymenko.github.io/artists
